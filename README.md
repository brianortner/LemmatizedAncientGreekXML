# LemmatizedAncientGreekXML

This repository contains Ancient Greek texts which have been tokenized, POS-tagged, sentence-splitted, and lemmatized automatically. The texts come from the following repositories, which currently contain most of the Ancient Greek texts freely accessible over the internet:

1. https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit/releases/tag/0.0.4
2. https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin/First1KGreek/releases/tag/v1.1

As for the tokenization, POS tagging and sentence splitting, the data rely on those provided in:

1. https://github.com/gcelano/CTSAncientGreekXML
2. https://github.com/gcelano/POStaggedAncientGreekXML

Refer to these repositories for further documentation. In the present repository, the POS tag + the word form of a token have been automatically linked to those contained in Morpheus and MorpheusUnderPhilologic. Since the latter databases also contain lemmata, this allowed their automatic extraction.
