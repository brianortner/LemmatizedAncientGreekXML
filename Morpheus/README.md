# Greek Morpheus

This folder contains an xml version of Greek Morpheus, the morphological analyzer for Ancient Greek. It has been used to extract lemmas when
a word form + postag in it coincides with those found in the Greek texts (where the postag has been assigned automatically by the Mate tagger).
